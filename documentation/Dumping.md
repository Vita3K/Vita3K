# Dumping Games

Dumping your games is the only legal way of obtaining commercial games, and the only allowed way to get games for Vita3K.

However, if you're after homebrew games, you can search online or visit [VitaDB](https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/). Be warned that some homebrew apps may contain potentially unwanted software like malware.

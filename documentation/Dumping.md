# Dumping Games

Dumping your games is the only legal way of obtaining commercial games, and the only allowed way to get games for Vita3K.

However, if you're after homebrew games, you can search online or visit [VitaDB](https://vitadb.rinnegatamante.it/#/). Be warned that some homebrew apps may contain potentially unwanted software like malware.

Please note that .pkg is for commercial games and .vpk is for homebrew games.

# Dumping methods

There are four ways to dump Vita games: MaiDump, [NoNpDrm](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm), Vitamin and FAGdec. However, MaiDump and Vitamin are not supported by Vita3K. Please do not ask why Vitamin doesn't work.

If the game is homebrew, it should be in a .vpk/.zip format if you want to install them, or if you prefer to copy them yourself, you can drag and drop the game folder in your `pref_path/ux0/app` folder.

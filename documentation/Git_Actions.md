# Vita3K's use of GitHub actions

As many other projects on GitHub, Vita3K makes use of GitHub Actions to automate code analysis, formatting and building.

You can view the actions for C-C++ code generation and testing at `Vita3K/.github/workflows/c-cpp.yml`. CodeQL, the formatting checker, can be viewed at `Vita3K/.github/workflows/
